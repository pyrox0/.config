*** This contains my Packagefiles
**** What are Packagefiles?
Packagefiles are my custom format for installing
system-level packages on my machines
**** What is the format?
Simple. 1 package per line, along with that package's flags.
That's it. Really. Take a look at them if you don't believe me.
Also, each Packagefile is named after what it installs packages for.
src_sh{Pipfile} for src_sh{pip}, src_sh{Npmfile} for src_sh{npm}, etc.
